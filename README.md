# I am closing down the Modulo project
As of writing this, Modulo is no longer maintained. While it was initially built to provide a modern and convenient tool for the demoscene/tracker-centric Discord communities, the response I got made the development unsustainable. Not only the bot was not used, but the amount of harassment, dehumanization and toxicity I have faced from the members of the demoscene community left me, to say the least, unsatisfied and disappointed, and I have chosen to abandon the project and step away from the community entirely.  
The source code remains available under a free software license for those wishing to host their own instance or expand upon it, but do not expect any kind of support from me. I will not be providing any sort of help with the codebase or engage in community interactions.  
Thank you to everybody who supported this project for the last few months, and I wish you all the best.  
Goodbye.
